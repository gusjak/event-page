## Mission

This is a school assignment in which the programs Web Developer and IP Graphical Production & Form at Yrgo are collaborating.
Our mission is to create an event invitation in both physical and digital form.
We get to choose ourselves for a real company or organisation and create either a fictitious or a recurring event.

We have decided to go with the microbrewery company Mikkeller and create a beer launching event.

<details><summary><strong>Project requirements:</strong></b></summary>

- A unique <strong><ins>landing page</ins></strong> that follows the same graphic manner of the chosen company.
- The website needs to be responsive and built mobile-first and follow the accessibility standard WCAG (https://a11yproject.com/checklist/).
- It must contain at least five animations, one of which is an in-animation when the page is first displayed.
- It should have a CTA where visitors can sign up via a form to the event. This form only needs to be shown visually.
- The landing page should be personalized via a link that can be sent out with query parameters. Suggestions for at least two ways to personify the site via the link such as name, country, pictures, occupational group, etc.
- The website should be built statically through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- From day one, the website should be pushed up to a public repository on GitHub.
- The website should upload to a hosting service such as. Netlify, Vercel or GitHub Pages.
- The website should be optimized and have as high a score as possible on https://web.dev/ (optimize images, CSS and JS, tips are to use construction tools such as Parcel).
- Each group must submit a review of another group the day before the presentation. Code reviews must be submitted with a pull request.
